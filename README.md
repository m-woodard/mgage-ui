# Mgage UI

Mgage UI is my first [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) project for creating and sharing modern and engaging UI layouts and snippets.

##Notes

- Source code for some of the layouts and snippets have been taken from other open source projects and adapted to fit my needs.
- Most of the layouts adhere to my personal design aesthetic which is very minimalistic and resembles a lot of material design.
- This is my first actual project, and any feedback is greatly appreciated.

##Usage

These files are pretty simple in their usage as they are just groups of HTML, CSS, and JS files. But for those who may be even less code-savvy than myself, here are a few simple steps to use these layouts and snippets. 

- Pick which layout or snippet you would like to use.
- Download the corresponding folder as a zip file (you can also clone it if you like).
- Extract the items from the zip file.
- Upload the files to whatever environment you are using.
- Using your preferred text/editor, modify the appropriate 'index.html' file to reference the corresponding 'style.css' and 'script.js' files. If you need more assistance with completing this step, please Google it (link to a more detailed guide to come).
- Save the modified 'index.html' file to your environment.
- Open the modified 'index.html' file in your preferred browser to view the layout or snippet.

*Feel free to customize these layouts and snippets however you like to fit your needs. 
*If you have any issues with customizing them, or you find an error or room for inprovement in the source code - please let me know!
*If you have customized any of these to create a new layout, I would love to see it - and may eventually try to create a repository to display other people's versions.
